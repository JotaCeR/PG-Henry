# Henry Autocinema {Nombre Aqu√≠}

### About
This repository it's the final proyect of **Henry** bootcamp a requirement for completing the course and get certificated. It was developed by a team of full-stack devs driven by the *SCRUM* methodology. The team members are: <a href="https://github.com/juancereceda">Juan Martin Cereceda</a>, <a href="https://github.com/maurohaidr">Mauro Haidr</a>, <a href="https://github.com/RuthCodina">RuthCodina</a>, <a href="https://github.com/WilmarDeML">Wilmar De MelquisedeLisbec</a>, <a href="https://github.com/JotaCeR">Juan Roberts</a>, <a href="https://github.com/CelenyAndrea">CelenyAndrea</a>, <a href="https://github.com/Yiftleh">Gianfranco</a> & <a href="https://github.com/rafamossetto">Rafa Mossetto</a>.

### Proyect
This is a web-app developed with the *MERN* stack which stands for: **MongoDB**, **Express**, **ReactJS/ReduxJS** & **NodeJS**. The proyect it's about an *e-commerce* and *management* app for an autocinema. With a well driven sign-in/sign-up implementation and authentication system allows the users to buy movie tickets and miscellanous extras from the candybar, process their payment and checkout a successfull buy so they only need to show a virtual ticket on the cinema entrance with a validating QR.

### Growing Stack
The team assembled from **Henry** bootcamp knew *SQL* through **PostgreSQL** for DataBase management. However the choosing of changing a safe-zone for a new technologie such as **MongoDB** reflexes greatly the hunger for knowledge and sense of curiosity that team members have. Also the choosing wasn't naive: expanding their own stack not just with a new technology but also with a **Non-SQL** kind of technology, growing in versatility.

### Authentication
*Authentication* process through *local-storage* data and the use of tokens with *json-web-token* was kind of a huge challenge from which the team finished succesfull. The app hashes succesfully the user's accounts passwords, holds a logged-in account token for 24 hours before asking for a new process of signing-in. And verifies authentication for users and not just for admins both in the *front-end* and the *back-end*. So routes and paths to the back-end can't either be "back-doored".

### Adaptability 
Even if the app it's **not** responsive at 100%, it's design shows a great adaptability for any kind of screen even cellphone's screens. However it's a *pending* upgrade developing a mobile version with ***React Native*** who fully adapts for cellphones.

### Intuitive 
It has a great *UI/UX* design which not only ease the buying and checking out experience for customers but also ease the **adminsitration** experience making it easy to update prices, billboards and any other miscellaneous topics for the product owner.

### Flexibility
Thanks to the powerfull combination between **ReactJS** and **MongoDB** the app architecture allows a nice and easy way to update and add new products and movies for example. Specially **MongoDB** implementation makes the app scalability really deep and flexible specially for non-developers users.

## Deployment
The capabilitie and operationality of this app can be experienced <a href="https://henry-movie-app.vercel.app/">here</a>. The proyect has been deployed between *Vercel* and *Heroku*, naturally the **front-end** is deployed on Vercel and the **back-end** is deployed on Heroku.
